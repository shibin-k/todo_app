# Pre-work - Todo App

Todo App is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.
Planning to enhance this app by allowing users to add optional notification rules so that users can get notified by alerts, emails, texts etc. when TODO item is due.

## User Functionalities

* [ ] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [ ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [ ] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them

The following features will be considered for future commits:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item) and add support for notification rules
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
